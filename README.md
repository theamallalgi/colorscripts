- build it from source (with make)

### 1. Use Scoop

```bash
scoop install colorscript # install and setup colorscripts
```

### 2. Use `install.sh` script

clone the repo, and proceed to the directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theamallalgi/colorscripts.git # clone git repo
cd colorscripts # change directory to colorscripts/
```

run the install script with sudo privileges
```sh
sudo ./install.sh # run install script
```

run the cli for the first time
```sh
colorscript --random # displays a random colorscript
```

### 3. Build from Source

clone the repo, and proceed to the directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theamallalgi/colorscripts.git # clone git repo
cd colorscripts # change directory to colorscripts/

## Contributions

we welcome contributions from the community! Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing to the `colorscripts` project:

**Commit Messages:**

* We follow the conventional commit message format. This ensures consistency and helps track changes effectively.
* Use the prefix `feat(ansi):` for commits that add new ANSI color art scripts to the repository.

**Adding New Art:**

* Create your art using ANSI color escape sequences.
* Ensure the art utilizes only the terminal's 8-color palette for broad compatibility.
* Save your art script as a simple filename (e.g., `spiral`, `firework`) in the `colorscripts` folder, avoiding extensions like `.sh`.
* Use hyphens (-) for separators in filenames if needed.
* When adding a new art script, commit your changes with the following format:
```sh
feat(ansi): add art-name colorscript
```

**Example Commit Message:**

```sh
feat(ansi): add fire-wave colorscript
```

This message indicates that you've added a new colorscript named `fire-wave` that utilizes ANSI color codes.

**Additional Notes:**

* Feel free to open an issue or pull request to discuss your art contribution before starting.
* We appreciate any suggestions for improvement or bug fixes.
* Refer to the existing code for reference on how to structure your new art script.

By following these guidelines, you can help us make `colorscripts` even more vibrant and visually engaging!
